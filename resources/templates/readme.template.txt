# Installation of %app_title% %app_version%

1. Go to your "Saved Games" DCS Scripts folder, which is likely located at C:\Users\<username>\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\
   (this is NOT the Scripts folder in the DCS installation directory, e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DCSWorld\Scripts)
2. Only if you haven't previously done this: Append the content of add-to-Export.lua to your existing Export.lua in your DCS Scripts folder.
   If you already have done this previously, you must skip this step.
3. Copy %output_script_name% to your DCS Scripts folder
4. Place the %html_file_name% anywhere you like, e.g., on your Desktop


# Usage of %app_title% %app_version%

2. Start a mission in DCS and observe the data being shown in your browser
