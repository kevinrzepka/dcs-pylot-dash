# Privacy Policy

## Types of Information we receive from you & how we get it

### Your Contributions

All data you actively enter and submit to our services is processed. However, this data is not persistently stored by
us.
We specifically ask you to please not enter any personally identifiable information (like your name or email address)
into our services.
Please also see our [Terms of Service](terms_of_service.md).

### IP Addresses

By using our services, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to
access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.

### Browser HTTP request data

Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit our website. This
information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some
beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the
type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile
carrier, the website that referred you to our website, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time
of each request you make to our services.

## Information we collect

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include:

- JavaScript, which is used to enhance the security of our sites, provide analytic data, deliver our services, and
  ensure site reliability
- A variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as local storage and session storage, which are used to deliver
  our services as requested

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address),
and information about your use of our website (like the time of your visit).

## How we store your Information

The only information we store is the IP address and browser HTTP request data. This information is stored in log
files ("Access Logs"). Therefore, the only Personal Information we store
is the IP address.

## Why & how we use information we receive from You

### IP Addresses, Browser HTTP request data

We use IP addresses and browser HTTP request data to help diagnose problems with our server infrastructure,
to administer our website, and to ensure the reliable and secure delivery of our services.

### Your Contributions

Data entered into our services by you is used to provide you with our services.

## When may we share Your Information?

We never sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything under any
circumstances.
We do not share your Personal Information with anyone under normal circumstances.
Circumstances that may lead us to share your Personal Information are those described below.

### For Legal Reasons

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to
satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or
administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally
invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we
will try our best to fight it.
As we do not have any means to contact you, since an IP address is the only information we have,
we cannot give you any notice of such legal requests.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's
request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the
advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

### To protect you, ourselves & others

We need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or
investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy. We may also need to access and
share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably
necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect us or the public.
We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary
to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and
security or technical concerns.

## How do we protect your Personal Information?

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of
physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and
physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing
as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by
technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

## How long do we keep your Information?

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time required for supporting
our legitimate interest in the operation, maintenance and security of our services,
and our obligations under applicable law.
In most instances, Personal Information is deleted or de-identified after 90 days.

## Our response to Do Not Track (DNT) signals

We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information
only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When May We Share Your Information" section of
this Privacy Policy.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and because we do not track users in any way
beyond what is technically required and described in this Privacy Policy in the first place,
we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We keep this Privacy Policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page.
This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 10th 2025.
